* Characters

** Adiantuinne Tribe
*** Uimi Na-Hagousóirí
(Autistic-coded)
A Saiote girl in her mid 20s. She has trauma because she was raised in the First Realm (i.e. Tuscar
territorry) where she tried to fit in but couldn't because she wasn't Tuscar, nor was she raised Tuscar.
She was bullied because of this and was generally made to feel defective and worthless.

Now she has developed a superiority complex. She has spent countless hours fixated researching
how to use music, scents, appearances—basically everything- to control and manipulate
the emotions of others, to make them feel what she wants them to feel. Because she never felt
socially in control as a child, now she wants to control others.

*** Taigtaig Magann
A young Saiote girl (like 19 or 20). Has social anxiety and is a people-pleaser. Likes daydreaming and
fantasizing. Is somewhat of a goody-two-shoes, but semi-secretly has a fascination with crime and
violence.
